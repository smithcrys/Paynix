      <h2>📘 Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Paynix project is a comprehensive FinTech mobile application prototype developed to simplify and modernize digital payments, peer-to-peer transfers, and financial management for everyday users. 
        As a mobile-first platform, Paynix eliminates the complexities of traditional banking systems, offering an intuitive interface tailored for smartphone users.
        Its features—ranging from e-wallet functionalities to bill payments and transaction history—are designed to cater to users looking for convenience, security, and a seamless user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project emphasizes strong UI/UX principles, resulting in a fully responsive dark-themed prototype created in Figma.
        Supporting documentation, UML diagrams (Activity, Class, and Use Case), and user feedback collected via Google Forms underpin the systematic development process.
        With version control and collaboration facilitated through GitHub, Paynix stands as a complete, well-documented FinTech application concept, ready for presentation or future development phases.
